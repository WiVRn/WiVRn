# Configurable items

Configuration is done on server side.
Files are read from
- `/usr/share/wivrn/config.json` (where `/usr` is selected at configure time with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`)
- `/etc/wivrn/config.json`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wivrn/config.json` or if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, `$HOME/.config/wivrn/config.json`.

Files later in the list replace top-level values from previous ones.

If you installed WiVRn from a flatpack, the config is in `$HOME/.var/app/io.github.wivrn.wivrn/config/wivrn/config.json`.

All elements are optional and have default values.

## `bit-depth`
Default value: `8` (bits)

Bit depth of the video. 8-bit is supported by all encoders. 10-bit is supported by `vaapi` and `nvenc` encoders using `h265` or `av1`.

## `encoder`
The encoder to use, either a single string or object applied to all streams, or a list of string or objects with values for left, right and alpha.
When a string it is used, it is equivalent to the `encoder` item of the object.

WiVRn encodes each eye separately, and the alpha channel as one for both eyes. Each stream is processed independently, this may use resources more effectively and reduce latency.
All the provided encoders are put into groups, groups are executed concurrently and items within a group are processed sequentially.

### `encoder`
Default value: `nvenc` if Nvidia GPU and compiled with nvenc, `vaapi` for all other GPU when compiled with ffmpeg, else `x264`.

Identifier of the encoder, one of
* `x264`: software encoding
* `nvenc`: Nvidia hardware encoding
* `vaapi`: AMD/Intel hardware encoding
* `vulkan`: experimental, for any GPU that supports vulkan video encode

### `codec`
Default value: best supported by both headset and encoder of `av1`, `h264`, `h265`.

One of `h264`, `h265`, `av1`, `raw`.

Not all encoders support every codec:
- `x264` encoder only supports `h264` codec
- `vulkan` encoder supports `h264` and `h265` codecs
- `raw` encoder only supports `raw` codec
- `nvenc` and `vaapi` support all codecs, except `raw`

If `nvenc` encoder is in use, you can refer to [nvidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-support-matrix) to make sure that your GPU supports encoding with the desired codec.

### `group` (advanced)
Default value: One value for each encoder type (nvenc, vaapi, vulkan, x264).

Identifier (number) of the encoder group. Encoders with the same identifier are executed sequentially, in the order they are defined in the configuration. Encoders with different identifiers are executed concurrently.
Default setting will have all encoders of a given type execute sequentially, and different types in parallel.

### Examples
1. Simple configuration
```json
{
	"encoder": {
		"encoder": "vaapi",
		"codec": "h265"
	}
}
```
Use vaapi hardware encoding, h265 video codec (HEVC).

2. Hardware + software encoder
```json
{
	"encoder": [
		{
			"encoder": "vaapi",
			"codec": "h265",
		},
		{
			"encoder": "x264",
			"codec": "h264",
		},
		{
			"encoder": "vaapi",
			"codec": "h265",
		},
	]
}
```
Creates a hardware encoder for left eye and transparency, and a software encoder for right eye.

### `device`, only for vaapi
Default value: unset

Manually specify the device for encoding, can be used to offload encode to an iGPU. Device shall be in the form "/dev/dri/renderD128".


### `options` (very advanced), only for vaapi
Default value: unset

Json object of additional options to pass directly to ffmpeg `avcodec_open2`'s `option` parameter.

## `application`
Default value: unset

An application to start when connection with the headset is established, can be a string or an array of strings if parameters need to be provided.

### Example
```json
{
	"application": ["steam", "steam://launch/275850/VR"]
}
```
Launch No Man's Sky in VR mode on Steam when connection with headset is established.

## `tcp-only`
Default value: `false`

Only use TCP for communications with the client, this may have increased latency.
If `false` or unset, WiVRn will use both TCP and UDP.

### Example
```json
{
	"tcp-only": true
}
```

## `publish-service`
Default value: `avahi`

How to publish the service over the network, `avahi` or null.

If set to null, service will not be published and address has to be entered manually on the headset.

## `openvr-compat-path`
Default value: unset

Provides the path to the directory of an OpenVR compatibility tool (such as OpenComposite).

If unset, WiVRn will autodetect the path of such a tool as usual (see [the SteamVR guide](./steamvr.md)).

If set to an null, WiVRn will not manage the OpenVR configuration.

## `hid-forwarding`
Default value: `false`

Only available when the `uinput` kernel module is loaded and the user has write access.

Enables the forwarding of keyboard and mouse input from the client to the server.

## `debug-gui`
Default value: `false`

Only available when built with `WIVRN_FEATURE_DEBUG_GUI`.

Enables the Monado debug gui.

## `use-steamvr-lh`
Default value: `false`

Only available when built with `WIVRN_FEATURE_STEAMVR_LIGHTHOUSE`

Enables the driver to load SteamVR Lighthouse devices.
